<p>Title: Insecurity</p>
<p>About “Unseen”: The <b>unseen</b> mentioned here is the <b>insecurity</b> of many new international students, not only in Canada but in all over the world. Such insecurity is considered “unseen” because it is a feeling that most people who do not experience it can hardly see it, or sometimes they just ignore it.  Due to many unexpected pressures, international students are uncertain about their future, and then become insecure of opening themselves to the world. The stories being told in this project are true stories collected from mine, my brother’s and my friends’ experiences who were and are international students from all over the world.</p>
<p>About the <b>concept</b>: The concept of this project is inspired by the movie “Inception” (directed by Christopher Nolan). “Inception” means entering dreams and planting the idea in someone’s head. Every page in this project, including the index page, is a different dream, in which I demonstrate or “plant” in you three kinds of insecurity that international students experience. All the dreams can take place in different situations without your awareness because when you are dreaming, it feels real and you can be anyone, and only when you wake up, you realize that there is something strange.</p>
<p>The dreams all start with the beginning of your insecurity, the experience of it and end with a spark of majority thoughts/hope but it does not last long.</p>
<p>Index page: The situation takes place when you walk into a garage that used to be your room, and you found some old photos, they represent the life you have forgotten about.</p>
<p>Page 2: You fall into the first dream and see yourself watching a slideshow of your thoughts about people closed to you. You live far from family, and you don’t feel on the same page with your friends who are from different cultures, so you wonder yourself if you actually exist anymore. This dream ends with a more mature thoughts of you and you decide to step out of your comfort zone. Suddenly, somebody is knocking on your door. Hover on the sentence "Are you homesick?", there is a hidden element. 
<p>Page 3:This page is scrolled horizontally. You are waiting for bus 84 to go home after a long day. You are insecure about dangerous things might happen that you are not familiar with. It reminds you of things happened unexpectedly to you and you were not able to solve it by yourself,  which makes you feel anxious because you are alone now. You try to think positively but this insecurity keeps coming back to you. The bus stops and open the door with a *ding* sound.</p>

<p>Page4: You are walking in the rain and see a puddle, so you look at it, try to find yourself. You acknowledge that you are responsible for your life so you cannot blame anyone. You keep wondering who you are and if you are doing well because you try so hard, yet it does not seem enough for you to get rid of this insecurity. You realize there is something strange.</p>
<p>Page 5: The alarm goes off, you wake up. It is morning now and you have to prepare for a new day. You do not remember much of the dreams but you still feel the insecurity in your mind. Try hovering the last sentence. And I hope you realized the morse code I put in this page.</p>
